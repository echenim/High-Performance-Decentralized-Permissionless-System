# Crypto Package

## Overview

The `crypto` package is responsible for managing all cryptographic operations in the system. It provides utilities and algorithms essential for ensuring data security, integrity, and authenticity. This includes functions for hashing, digital signatures, key generation, and encryption/decryption.

## Features

1. **Hashing**:
   - Secure cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3).
   - Support for Merkle tree construction and verification.

2. **Digital Signatures**:
   - Generate and verify digital signatures using algorithms such as ECDSA or Ed25519.
   - Ensure the authenticity of transactions and messages.

3. **Key Management**:
   - Generate cryptographic key pairs.
   - Serialize and deserialize public/private keys.
   - Support for various key formats (e.g., PEM, DER).

4. **Encryption/Decryption**:
   - Symmetric encryption (e.g., AES).
   - Asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA).
